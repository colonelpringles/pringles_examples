    "- The user codes the atomic model in C++ following a certain interface\n",

    "- C++ code is compiled alongside with the CD++ library and a `cd++` executable file is generated\n",
    "- To execute the simulation of the model, `./cd++` is executed with the virtual duration to simulate and the .ma file as parameters\n",
    "- Simulation results are dumped into log and output files with a specific, ad hoc format\n",
    "- The user parses those files using some other tool (not cd++) to analyse the results of the simulation and probably generate some type of plot to display them."

It takes advantage of the great scientific computing tools built for Python: **Jupyter Notebooks** (with the new jupyter-lab environment), **matplotlib**, **pandas**, etc.  "
